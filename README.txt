App Description - 
    A website using an API that allows the user to utilitze Google Language Detection functionalities using the Node.js 
    library from the Cloud Translation API client library developed by google. 
    In this website we used MongoDB to store phrases that users have searched for on our website and we display this data when users click on the 
    the history page. We've also included a link that allows the users to remove all data from the database. The main functionalities of this website 
    gives the user a table of all the lanugages that google translate supports as well as detecting the language of a phrase that the user 
    have entered with the help of Cloud Translation API.
